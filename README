Battery of quick cognitive tests.

Edit `cogatrice.rb` to suit your needs.

Protocol:

1. Tracks basic variables like "energy level".
1. For every intervention, asks if you want to use it today and if so, if it should randomize it for you.
2. Performs all cognitive tests.
3. Saves results under `logs` in same directory.
4. `analyze.rb` does some basic aggregation and gives you results in `analysis/*.csv`.

Supported tests:

1. Simple arithmetic (1+8 = ?), random accuracy ~10%
1. single n-back (n=3, ~30% are matches), random accuracy ~58% (if mixed strategy), ~50% (if guessing), ~70% (if always no)
1. Stroop test (5 colors), random accuracy ~20%
